# Brand_YOLOv8_logo_deploy
This repository contains code for utilizing the YOLOv7 object detection model to detect logos in videos and crop them to a specified directory. YOLOv7 is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection model, and this project focuses on leveraging its capabilities for logo detection in videos.

#Overview

This repository utilizes the YOLOv7 object detection model to detect logos in videos. The pretrained YOLOv7 model is applied to analyze videos, automatically cropping and saving detected logos to a specified output directory.

#Requirements

Python 3.x
OpenCV
YOLOv7 weights (pretrained on a logo detection dataset)

#Notes

Ensure that your YOLOv7 weights are up-to-date and pretrained on a logo detection dataset for optimal results.
